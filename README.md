# Python-Music-Sorters

A collection of Python commandâ€‘line tools for sorting music collections and playlists based on embedded metadata, Spotify data, or local audio analysis using Librosa.

## Main Features

  * Reorder any playlist in your iTunes/Music.app library by a chosen attribute
  * Supports embedded metadata (BPM, key, mood, color)
  * Analyzes local audio features (energy, brightness, spectral contrast, onset strength, MFCC, etc.) via Librosa
  * Falls back to Spotify popularity if needed (currently deprecated by Spotify)

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* [Mutagen](https://pypi.org/project/mutagen/) (ID3 & MP4 metadata parsing)
* [Librosa](https://pypi.org/project/librosa/) & [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) (audio feature extraction)
* [Spotipy](https://pypi.org/project/spotipy/) (Spotify Web API)

## Setup

2. Obtain Spotify API credentials (Client ID & Client Secret) and insert them at the top of the scripts:
